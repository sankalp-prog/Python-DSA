# Important Questions about Hash Maps 
### 1. What are time/space tradeoffs between adjacency list vs. adjacency matrix?
> **A:** The trade-off is that adjacency matrix takes less space if the graph is dense (high edge:vertex ratio), and adjacency list takes less space if the graph is sparse (few edges per vertex).
